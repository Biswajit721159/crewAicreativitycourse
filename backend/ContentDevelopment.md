Here is the complete and detailed educational content for the chapter "Linear Equations in One Variable" for Class 8, incorporating thorough explanations, examples, and illustrations for each subtopic:

1. **Introduction to Linear Equations:**
   - **Definition of Linear Equations:** A linear equation is an equation between two variables that gives a straight line when plotted on a graph. For example, \(y = 3x + 2\).
   - **Components of a Linear Equation:** A linear equation consists of constants, variables, and coefficients. The constants are the numbers, the variables are the letters, and the coefficients are the numbers in front of the variables.
   - **Importance of Linear Equations in Mathematics:** Linear equations are foundational in algebra and are used in various fields like physics, economics, and computer science.

2. **Types of Linear Equations in One Variable:**
   - **Simple Linear Equations:** These are equations that can be written in the form \(ax = b\). For example, \(2x = 4\).
   - **Linear Equations with Coefficients:** These are equations that have a constant multiplied by the variable. For example, \(3x = 9\).
   - **Linear Equations with Fractions:** These equations involve fractions. For example, \((1/2)x = 5\).
   - **Linear Equations with Decimals:** These equations involve decimals. For example, \(0.5x = 2.5\).

3. **Solving Linear Equations:**
   - **Solving Simple Linear Equations:** To solve such equations, we isolate the variable on one side of the equation. For example, to solve \(2x = 4\), we divide both sides by 2 to get \(x = 2\).
   - **Solving Linear Equations with Coefficients:** Here also, we isolate the variable. For example, to solve \(3x = 9\), we divide both sides by 3 to get \(x = 3\).
   - **Solving Linear Equations involving Fractions and Decimals:** In such cases, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of the coefficient of \(x\).
   - **Checking the solution of Linear Equations:** Substituting the obtained value of the variable in the original equation to check if both sides are equal.

4. **Word Problems Related to Linear Equations:**
   - **Formulating Linear Equations from Word Problems:** This involves interpreting the problem and coming up with the equation.
   - **Solving Linear Equations from Word Problems:** This involves solving the formulated equation.
   - **Checking the solution of Word Problems:** This involves substituting the obtained value in the original problem to see if it makes sense.

5. **Applications of Linear Equations in Various Fields:**
   - **Application in Geometry:** Linear equations are used in finding the area of shapes, length of lines, etc.
   - **Application in Physics:** They are used in calculating velocity, force, etc.
   - **Application in Economics:** They are used in calculating cost, revenue, etc.
   - **Application in Real-life scenarios:** They are used in calculating distances, time, etc.

6. **Practice Problems and Exercises:**
   - **Practice Problems on Simple Linear Equations:** For example, solve \(5x = 15\).
   - **Practice Problems on Linear Equations with Coefficients:** For example, solve \(6x = 18\).
   - **Practice Problems on Linear Equations involving Fractions and Decimals:** For example, solve \((1/3)x = 3\), solve \(0.2x = 1.2\).
   - **Practice Problems on Formulating and Solving Word Problems:** For example, If John has twice as many apples as Jack and the total number of apples they have is 30, how many apples does each have?
